				<ul>

				</ul>
				<p>Certain other <b>writing </b>courses may also be used to qualify. Check with the Hopwood Assistant Director to determine course eligibility. Freshmen who place out of the required composition course are eligible to enter the Underclassmen Contest if they present an official statement from the appropriate office. A contestant may use as a qualifying course one taken in the past two years. Spring/Summer writing courses may also be used for qualification. The rule requiring a writing course is unwaivable. A literature course does not qualify a student.</p>
				<p>In this contest three types of writing are eligible: nonfiction, fiction, and poetry. In each of these fields, prizes usually ranging from $500 to $1,750 are awarded. Entries in each of the three fields are limited as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The page limits for the poetry division are 10–25 pages.</li>
					<li>The page limits for the nonfiction and fiction divisions are 15–40 pages. All non-fictional prose, including creative nonfiction, will be considered in the nonfiction division.</li>
					<li>Pages should be numbered consecutively.</li>
					<li>A student may submit manuscripts in more than one field.</li>
					<li>No Underclassmen Contest submission may be entered in any other fall term contest, with the exception of the Cowden Fellowship Contest.</li>
					<li>Only the written portions of mixed-media manuscripts may be submitted.</li>
					<li>Manuscripts should be typed or word-processed on 8 ½ x 11-inch white paper. They should be doubled-spaced on one side of the paper only, with a left-hand margin of at least one and one-half inches. Poems need not be double-spaced throughout.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Three copies </b>of each entry shall be submitted, each set bound in a folder with title, pen name, and category on the cover. Each folder in a division should be identical to the others in terms of content.</p>
				<p>Only binders which require punched paper are acceptable. Plastic covers, ring binders, and thesis binders will not be accepted. Samples of inexpensive acceptable binders will be on a display in the Hopwood Room, and recyclced ones will be given out while supplies last.</p>
				<p>A pen name which is entirely different from the contestant's real name is required to insure objectivity in judgment. One pen name only, regardless of how many categories entered.</p>
				<p>Accompanying the manuscripts shall be one entry form (obtained in the <b>Hopwood Room</b>, 1176 Angell Hall).</p>
				<p>Three-hole punches will be available in the Hopwood Room. On the day of the contest deadline, the Hopwood Room will be closed. However, completed and assembled manuscripts will be accepted at the door between 8:30 a.m. and 12:00 noon—absolutely no later. The contest deadline will be enforced to the minute. Manuscripts may be submitted at any time during the fall term prior to the deadline. Since last-minute problems do arise, contestants are urged to turn in their work early. &nbsp;</p>
				<p>A transcript is not needed for this contest.</p>
				<p><i><b>Note: </b>If you participate in need-based aid programs, be aware that your award is considered a "resource" and could impact your award package.</i></p>
				<h3>Announcement of Awards</h3>
				<p>Names of the winners in this competition will be announced early in the winter term. A manuscript that has received a prize in the contest for underclassmen will not be eligible for any subsequent Hopwood contest. Prizes may be redistributed in the event that the merit in a particular field makes such redistribution desirable. The committee reserves the right to keep on file one copy of each winning manuscript. A five-year archive of previous recipients of awards can be seen here.</p>
				<h3>Contest Deadline</h3>
				<p>Due no later than <b>Tuesday, December 9, 12:00 noon</b>.&nbsp;</p>

			<div>
				<p><b>Awards are offered in the following genres:</b> Novel, drama, screenplay, nonfiction (any form of nonfiction prose, including creative nonfiction), short fiction and poetry.</p>

				<p>The contest is open to all University of Michigan students, whether candidates for a degree or not, who are regularly enrolled in the University. Undergraduates must carry at least six hours of regular University work each term. Graduate students must also be regularly enrolled in the University and must carry at least 3 credits each term.</p>
				<p>To be eligible, a student must have been enrolled in one course in writing for 2–3 credits within the past two years or be taking a writing course in the current term.

				<p>No graduate student may enter the Hopwood Contest for more than a total of four times or re-enter an area in which he or she has previously won an award, though he or she may compete in other areas.</p>
				<p>Students who have been enrolled in the fall term but will not be enrolled in the following term (<i>e.g.</i>, December graduates) may compete, provided they have fulfilled the above requirements. Such students must submit their manuscripts not later than <b>December 18 by 4:00 p.m</b>. and should arrange to have their transcripts sent to the Hopwood Room after their fall term grades have been recorded. Students studying abroad may submit by <b>noon on February 11</b>.</p>
				<p>Each student must order an unofficial transcript (in 1010 LSA) and bring or mail it to the Hopwood Room (1176 Angell Hall) in sufficient time to meet the contest deadline. Transcripts downloaded from Wolverine Access are acceptable provided the contestant's name is printed clearly at the top of the page. If a student's transcript is not received by the contest deadline, the entry will be disqualified.</p>
				<p>No manuscript or part of a manuscript that has received an award in any contest administered by the Hopwood Program may be entered in any subsequent contest. This rule does not apply to contestants in the Cowden, Kasdan, and Miller Scholarship competitions.</p>
				<p>The same material may not be submitted in different categories (for example, nonfiction and fiction or short fiction and novel).</p>
				<p>No manuscript or part of a manuscript that has been published in a medium other than a college magazine or college newspaper may be entered in any contest. However, work that has been accepted for publication but that has not appeared in print by the time of the contest deadline may be entered.</p>
				<p>Only original work may be entered in the contest. Collaborations, translations, and adaptations are not acceptable. Only the written portion of mixed-media manuscripts may be submitted.</p>
				<p>Except in the case of novels, only completed works (as opposed to works-in-progress) may be submitted.</p>
				<p>No change may be made in a manuscript once it has been submitted. Students are advised to proofread their work very carefully.</p>
				<p>The committee reserves the right to retain for its files one copy of each winning manuscript.</p>
				<p>Each contestant winning an award will be required to sign the following statement: "In case of the publication of the manuscript submitted by me in the Hopwood Contest, and forming the basis for the award I have received, I agree to indicate in a footnote or otherwise that this manuscript was granted a prize in the Avery Hopwood and Jule Hopwood Contest for [<i>year of award</i>] at The University of Michigan."</p>
				<p>The committee does not accept responsibility for the safety of any manuscript presented in the contests.</p>
				<p>The rules of the Hopwood Contest are determined by the Hopwood Committee and administered by the Hopwood Assistant Director, whose decision is final.</p>

Awards range from $1,000 to $3,000.</p>
				<h3>Manuscript</h3>
				<p>Each student must fill out an application form and submit a sample of his or her writing in the areas of drama, screenplay, nonfiction, fiction, or poetry. &nbsp;The writing sample should consist of no more than 30 pages of prose and/or poetry. <b>One copy</b> of the writing sample and <b>one copy </b>of the application form are required. &nbsp;Work may be submitted to the staff in the Hopwood Room at any time during the Fall semester and up to the contest deadline. &nbsp;A contestant may win the Cowden Fellowship only once. &nbsp;The same manuscript may be submitted in other fall and winter term contests administered by the Hopwood Program; prize-winning manuscripts may also be submitted in this contest.
